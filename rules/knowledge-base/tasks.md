# Task Management Rules

Tasks use structured files in `context/tasks/` with one file per task.

## Task File Schema

```yaml
---
title: Task Title
id: TASK-001
status: open | in_progress | blocked | done | cancelled
priority: critical | high | medium | low
created_by: Person Name
created_at: YYYY-MM-DD
last_edited: YYYY-MM-DD
owners: [Person Name]
deadline: YYYY-MM-DD          # optional — drives the reminder engine
escalation_contact: Person    # optional — looped in at the final tick / overdue
stakeholders: [Person Name]
upstream: [TASK-XXX]
downstream: [TASK-XXX]
linked_events: [EVT-NNN]
tags: [category]
visibility: open
editable_by: open
---
```

## Required Fields

| Field | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `id` | `TASK-NNN` (zero-padded) | Unique identifier |
| `title` | String | Short descriptive title |
| `status` | Enum | `open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`, `cancelled` |
| `priority` | Enum | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` |
| `created_by` | String | Creator's name |
| `created_at` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | Creation date |
| `last_edited` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | Last modification date |
| `owners` | List | People responsible for completing |

## Creating a Task

1. Check `active.md` for the last used ID
2. Assign the next `TASK-NNN` ID
3. Create `context/tasks/TASK-NNN.md` with all required frontmatter
4. Include Description, Checklist, Dependencies, and Comments sections
5. Add an initial comment noting creation
6. Update `context/tasks/active.md` index

## Modifying a Task

1. Update the relevant frontmatter fields
2. Set `last_edited` to today's date
3. Append a comment with timestamp, user, and what changed
4. If adding a dependency, update BOTH tasks (upstream on one, downstream on the other)
5. Update `active.md` if status, priority, or ownership changed

## Comments

**Comments are append-only** — never delete or modify existing comments.

Format:
```markdown
## Comments

| Date | User | Comment |
|------|------|---------|
| 2026-04-10 14:30 | Bob | Created task from Slack discussion |
| 2026-04-11 09:00 | The assistant | Status changed: open → in_progress |
```

## Task-Event Linking

- Tasks have `linked_events: [EVT-NNN]` in frontmatter
- Events have `linked_tasks: [TASK-NNN]` in frontmatter
- **When creating a link, update BOTH files** (the task and the event)
- Events use `EVT-NNN` IDs and live in `context/calendar/`

## Dependencies

- `upstream`: Task IDs that must complete before this task can start (blocked by)
- `downstream`: Task IDs that depend on this task completing (this task blocks)
- **When adding a dependency, update BOTH tasks**
- GitHub-synced tasks (`GH-*`) populate `upstream`/`downstream` automatically from
  GitHub issue **blocked-by / blocking** relations, and `estimate` from a ProjectV2
  number field — so the dependency graph spans hand-authored + synced tasks. Sub-issue
  hierarchy is captured separately as `gh_parent` / `gh_sub_issues`. Cross-source
  edges may be one-directional unless mirrored by hand.

## PM orchestration

A weekly background loop reviews this task graph (#31). It flags what's **blocked**
(an upstream isn't done), **blocking** others (a downstream is still open), **overdue**,
and **due soon**, plus per-owner load, then wakes the assistant to re-estimate /
re-plan and DM the people on the critical path. The assistant **acts optimistically**
(applies the estimate/deadline/status change) and then asks the owner to confirm —
it does not ask first. Overdue/blocking work with **no assignee** is surfaced too:
the assistant finds/assigns an owner or raises it to the PM lead (`PM_LEAD`) and
the channel rather than dropping it. The routine also runs **on demand from chat** —
an allowlisted user can say "run pm orchestration" or "/pm". Tunable via `PM_*`
env vars; see `.env.example`.

## Deadlines & Reminders

Any task with a machine-readable `deadline:` (an ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`) is picked up
by the **escalating-deadline reminder engine**. As the deadline approaches the
engine posts reminders to the team channel on a tightening ladder (default
T-3 weeks → T-1 week → T-3 days → T-1 day), naming the `owners`. The final rung
(and an overdue notice) loops in the `escalation_contact` (or the org-wide
default). Tasks whose `status` is `done`/`cancelled` are never reminded about.

- Set `deadline` to enable reminders; omit it for tasks without a hard date.
- `escalation_contact` is optional — it falls back to the engine default.
- Each rung is sent at most once; moving the `deadline` re-arms the ladder.
- A rolling "everything with a deadline" digest (grouped by week and by owner)
  is written to `context/deadline-digest.md`.

The ladder/cadence/target channel are operator-tunable via `REMINDER_*` env
vars (see `.env.example`). Implementation: `src/reminder-engine.ts`.
